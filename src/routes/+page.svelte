            <p class="text-lg font-semibold w-[60rem]">
                I'm an aspiring software engineer, graduating with my B.S. in CS from CSUF in December of 2023! I'm looking for full-time roles related to software engineering,
                data engineerings, or any engineering where I can make an impact!
                <br><br>
                Lately, I've been working on web development projects using SvelteKit or Next.js, but I've been slowly expanding into other cool fields! My next/current projects
                have more of a focus on things concerning data, learning more about computer vision, and trying to re-activate my electrical engineering knowledge with some
                light embedded software projects.
                <br><br>
                As for some of my personal interests, I love cars, motorcycles, and just motorsports in general! I currently have too many vehicles, but my favorite is my
                2001 Mazda Miata that I'm planning to track. Maybe I'll add a baja bug or some form of open wheel car to the mix, but that's something in the works. Combining
                my passion for cars and passion for developing software is something I'm very interested in, and have worked on some car-related projects!
